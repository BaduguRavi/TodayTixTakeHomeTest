We don't use CardIO with Pods, because this Framework not support Dynamic Frameworks.
But Swrve SDK is need use_frameworks! on Pod. (NOTE: no longer need Swrve SDK so look into this)

We need to update Card IO periodically manually.
To do that:
1) Goto: https://github.com/card-io/card.io-iOS-SDK/releases
2) Download the latest release
3) Copy CardIO folder to our project.
